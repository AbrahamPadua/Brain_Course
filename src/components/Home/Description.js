        <h1>The Mind</h1>
        <p>
          The mind is the set of faculties including cognitive aspects such as
          consciousness, imagination, perception, thinking, intelligence,
          judgement, language and memory, as well as noncognitive aspects such
          as emotion and instinct.

        <h1>The Brain</h1>
        <p>
          The brain is part of your body’s central nervous system. It’s the most
          complicated part of your body. It has the ability to send and receive
          an enormous amount of information. Because it is so complex, there are
          some things doctors and scientists don’t completely understand yet
          about it. This also means that there are some amazing things you may
          not know about your brain.
